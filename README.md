## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from algorithms on music streaming platforms. Spotify and Apple Music both utilize algorithms that recommend playlists that have a certain mood or emotion associated with the songs, and we wanted to mimic this algorithm without a person to individually tag all the songs. 

## General info 
A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform. We used the spectrogram as out method of data collection per audio input. A trend is calculated using a training data set, the results of which can be applied to a test data set with different songs.
