## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from algorithms on music streaming platforms. Spotify and Apple Music both utilize algorithms that recommend playlists that have a certain mood or emotion associated with the songs, and we wanted to mimic this algorithm without a person to individually tag all the songs. 

## General info 
The algorithm uses a ___sound frequency thing___ to analyze the frequency (and others?) of audio input and categorize the song as one of three moods: happy, sad, and calm.

## Setup 


## What we learned
We learned how complex and powerful the algorithms behind the Amazon and Google APIs were, including the ability to give numerical values to how positive or negative a sentence is.

For others, this was our first official hackathon and we learned that it is critical to scope your project correctly.

## What's next
Our vision is for moodsic users to feel noticeably different after listening
